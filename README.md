# ShotEasy Pro

ShotEasy Pro is a small React + Vite app for creating framed screenshots with quick edits and exports.

## Screenshot

Replace `public/screenshot.png` with a screenshot of the app to make this README visual. When the file exists the image will be displayed below.

> If you don't have a `screenshot.png` yet, add one to the `public/` folder (root of the project). Vite serves files from `public/` at the site root.

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open the local URL printed by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173`)

## Build / preview

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Features

- Drag & drop or paste images into the editor
- Add frames, rounded corners, padding, and shadows
- Export as PNG / JPEG / WebP
- Copy image to clipboard (from supported browsers)

## Notes

- Favicon and header logo use `/icon.svg` from the `public/` directory. If you'd like a browser-specific thumbnail or other sizes, add files like `icon-browser.svg` or `favicon.png` in `public/` and update components accordingly.
- If the screenshot doesn't appear in the README after you add it, clear your browser cache or open the repo on GitHub (it will display images from the repo's `public/` folder).

## Want me to add the screenshot for you?

If you attach the screenshot file here (or place it in `public/screenshot.png`), I can add it into the repository so the README shows it live.

Happy screenshotting!
